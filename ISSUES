1. Connecting the google_map to the database and creating a controller and a view for it.

2. Create a ‘user favorites’ function. It should add object IDs under a user ID and
store this data in the db. When called, the object IDs should point back
to the actual object in the db.
The properties of the actual object will be used to get forecast info from the forecast db.

3.  Passing data between controllers.
